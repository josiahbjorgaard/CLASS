# CLASS: CLoud-based Autoscaling Spark Server

CLASS provides one-click deployment of your team's Apache Spark jobs using automated and resilient scaling of a multi-user, cloud based Spark server built on top of AWS, Kubernetes, and Prometheus. 

Value prop.-The project provides value by using computing resources efficiently through minimizing waisted AWS cost and by eliminating the time and effort spent by data engineers in deploying their cloud based data pipelines.

MVP-One-click deployment of a toy Spark job on an AWS EC2 instance.

Eng. Challenge - Containerizing Spark pipelines and running multiple Spark jobs on a Kubernetes cluster.
